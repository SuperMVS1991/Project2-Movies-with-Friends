    <h2 class="is-size-3 has-text-weight-semibold py-3">A word on spoilers...</h2>
    <p><span class="has-text-weight-bold">What actually is a spoiler?
    </span> A spoiler is any piece of information that reveals significant plot details or outcomes of a movie, potentially ruining the surprise or suspense for someone who has not yet watched the movie.
    </p>
    <p><span class="has-text-weight-bold">What is Movies with Friends' policy on spoilers?</span> Don't be a spoil-sport! We have two separate forums for a reason... if you are trying to learn more about a movie to see if it is something you'll enjoy, steer clear of the spoiler forum. If you want to post in the discussion, when in doubt about if your message contains a spoiler, play it safe and stick to the spoiler forum. Please be considerate of and courteous to your fellow members. </p>
